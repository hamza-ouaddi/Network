A social media service landing webpage

Another project that I just finished during my web development learning path. This project is a landing webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I really enjoyed making this webpage with Bootstrap that always make the responsive webpages easier. Furthermore, I'm so excited to continue my journey in learning to make amazing stuff later! If you have feedback, please feel free!01/28/2023]: I tried to update it with some new features using JavaScript, suck as the fade animation while scrolling, and the sidebar menu.
